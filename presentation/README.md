## Creative coding

Today we're getting **creative** with **code**.

For many of you, this will be a **memorable day**! You'll write your **first line of code**, and by mid-afternoon you'll have made **your very own app**, from **scratch**!

Exciting, informal, **fun**!

*On a practical note*, our **schedule** is.. we will have **breaks** at around 11:30 (half an hour) and 13:30 (1 hour). Aiming to wrap up by..


## Two words about myself



## Are you a coder?	

**I'm no computer scientist**. I learned to code by copying other people's code, and then changing (hacking) it. I learned to code **because**..

### Who makes code?

**Misconception**: coding is for people who really know what they're doing, who have code just flowing out of their brains.

Anyone who uses code to **solve problems or make things**, *creatively* and *collaboratively*.

A coder is someone like me, someone like you. 


## What is code?

Can you think of examples of words with `code` in them? (*Morse code*, *post code*, *dress code*... `when you go to a party and you're asked to dress in a certain way, that's a ... code`)

Code existed before computers.

Code is about **communication**. If I want to talk to my **grandma**, I need to use Italian. To communicate with you, I use English. To **talk to a computer**, I use..

It's **instructions** to a computer: extremely powerful, fundamentally thick.

Imagine a computer is your most pedantic **friend**: 

* **break down** every step
* be **precise**
* it will take you **literally**


## How do you learn to code?

Like **learning a new language**, **translating** your ideas into code.

**Today** you're going to learn **3 new languages**.

A bit of **grammar** and **vocabulary**, and mostly you can learn by **copying**.


## Copy + hack

To learn typography, you copy and **edit** fonts. 

To become a pattern cutter, you **deconstruct** and copy good garments.

To make things on the Web, you **inspect** and copy good websites.

_Show Facebook > Inspect Element_

**Today** you're going to **copy me** for a bit, then **hack** what you've copied into something **new**.


## HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Here are the **3 new languages** you'll get to know today: the languages of the Web.

Different **languages**, different **concerns** (or jobs/purposes)

HTML | CSS | JS
------------ | ------------- | ------------
structure and content | style and design   | behaviour and logic
what | how | if
ingredients | serving suggestions | method

_BBC homepage example > disable CSS to show what code does what_


## Today

To put all this into practice, you will make an **app**.  

I will show you a few **coding tricks** and we'll lay the **foundations** of your app together. 

Then you will explore the **potential of the Web** as an open platform for you to **express your creativity**.


## Become Web-literate

By making an app today, you will get to know the **fabrics** of the Web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and become **confident** to use code to **express your ideas creatively**.

Today is not about becoming professional coders (although this could be your starting point), but rather to become **confident in tinkering with code**. To see code as a **toolbox**, and not something **scary** or too **complex**.

You may want to become a fashion designer, or a (ask)? However as a **creative professional in the 21st century you canâ€™t be Web-illiterate**. Just like you have to be able to read and write, and do some maths. You need to understand a bit of code. 

You don't have to be a geek/nerd, the Web is for everyone.

Being Web-literate will enable you to use the Web as an **open platform**, a place where you can be a **maker**, instead of a **consumer**. 

Also it's a highly paid industry.

## Robot time!

Let's pretend I'm a **robot** and you have to **code me**.

* **Mission**: find an object in the room, pick it up.
* I only understand these **commands**: `walk(steps)` and `turn(degrees)`
* I can answer **questions**, only with a `yes` or `no`

People usually start with very *specific instructions* (eg: walk 3 steps, turn 45 degrees, walk 2 steps..)

We can then make these instructions more *abstract* and *flexible* with **logic** and **functions**.
	
(The idea is to engage people with an [easy task](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/31/0956797612446024.abstract) before we challenge them with a demanding one)
	

## Let's talk about POP

Principles of Programming

**Building blocks**

Variables | Functions | Logic
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Data | Actions   | Decisions
nouns | verbs | conjunctions

Explain functions with `makeTea( howMuchSugar, withMilk )`
